Create a file named app.ts (you can name it anything) and add the following contents:

class Demo{}
Copy
Remember, class is valid JavaScript. This is just a demo to show the output of the compiler.

Now open a terminal and run the tsc command against that file:

tsc main.ts
Copy
You'll see a file created called app.js with the contents:

var Demo = (function () {
    function Demo() {
    }
    return Demo;
}());
Copy
tsc has compiled your app.ts into an app.js following the "old" way of creating classes in JavaScript.

Try tsc app.ts -t ES6. This will "target" ES6 and use the "new" way of creating classes. So the contents of app.ts and app.js would be the same.
