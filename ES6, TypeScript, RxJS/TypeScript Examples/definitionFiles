Definition Files

A defintion files (d.ts) provides type information for external libraries.

lib.d.ts

TypeScript ships with a definition file that covers all the DOM methods, events, etc, so you don't have to worry about installing anything to work with the DOM.

npm install lodash @types/lodash

Currently

For the time being, you need a project called "typings" to manage all your definition files:

npm install -g typings

typings allows you to install, save, manage definition files through your terminal:

From the main registry:

typings install lodash --save

From the legacy dt (Definitely Typed) registry:

typings install dt~jquery --global --save

These commands add definition files to a the typings directory which tsc will resolve (unless you explicity exclude them in your tsconfig.json).
