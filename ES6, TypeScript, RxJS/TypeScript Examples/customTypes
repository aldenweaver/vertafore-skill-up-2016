type

Anywhere in your codebase you can define and export/import arbitrary types (which resemble object definitions):

type Food = {
    color:string
}

const apple = {color:"red"};
Copy
interface

You can also create the same type contract using a more traditional interface approach (which resemble class definitions):

interface Food{
    color:string
}

const apple = {color:"red"};
Copy
Optional

If certain properties/methods aren't required, you can mark them optional with a ?:

type Food = {
    color?:string
}

const apple:Food = {};
Copy
